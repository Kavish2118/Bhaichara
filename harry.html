                    <p><font size="9px"><strong>Summary:</strong></font><font size="5.5px"> In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry returns to Hogwarts for his second year, despite warnings from a house-elf named Dobby that it will be dangerous. Strange things start happening at school: students are being petrified, and ominous messages are found on the walls, claiming the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Harry, Ron, and Hermione investigate and discover that the monster from the Chamber is a basilisk, and the heir of Slytherin is controlling it. They find out that Tom Riddle, a memory preserved in a magical diary, has been using the diary to possess Ginny Weasley and force her to open the Chamber. Harry confronts and defeats the basilisk and destroys the diary, saving Ginny and restoring peace to Hogwarts.
